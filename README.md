Discord Pride RPC master

Show off your pride with the new LGBTQ+ Pride RPC! Use this to show your friends, family, co-workers, or just random people your pride! It's now easier than ever to show off your sexuality on Discord thanks to the addition of Custom Status, and now we are taking it to the next level with RPC.

You can add images to your status from our database to use in your status, and you can suggest new ones!

If you feel that something should be added to this code, please feel free to make a pull request. We love feedback and want to make the experience as pleasant as we can.

You can also submit images to be added to the RPC list, although we do have a limit. If you want to submit an image for consideration, create an issue with the flag `Feature Request`
